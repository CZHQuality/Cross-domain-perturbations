# Cross-Domain Transferable Perturbations 
Pytorch Implementation of "Cross-Domian Transferability of Adversarial Perturbations" (NeurIPS 2019) [(arXiv link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11736), [Project Page](https://muzammal-naseer.github.io/Cross-domain-perturbations/)

## Introduction

<p align="justify">The transferability of adversarial examples makes real-world attacks possible in black-box settings,
where the attacker is forbidden to access the internal parameters of the model. we propose a framework capable of launching highly transferable attacks that crafts adversarial patterns to mislead networks trained on different domains. The core of our proposed adversarial function is a generative network that is trained using a relativistic supervisory signal that enables domain-invariant perturbation</p>
